# Practical 10
 
## Name: Zhou Jie
## Estimation Accuracy
Throughout the duration of this subject, I initially found my estimations for how long tasks would take to be somewhat off the mark. I often either underestimated the complexity of the tasks or overestimated my ability to swiftly deal with unforeseen issues. However, as the course progressed, I noticed a distinct improvement in my estimation accuracy. This was likely due to a combination of better understanding the requirements and a more realistic appraisal of my coding speed and debugging process.

## Lessons from Code Reviews
Being on the receiving end of code reviews opened my eyes to the importance of writing clear, maintainable code. It's not just about making it work; it's about making your code understandable to others. The feedback I received helped me to refine my coding style and improve the quality of my work.

## Thoughts on Practical Tasks
If I were leading the course, I'd incorporate more real-world projects to bridge the gap between practice tasks and actual software development. I'd also emphasize version control from the start to better equip students for teamwork and industry practices.
